        <span>We know&nbsp;getting your car serviced is one of those ‘grudge purchases’ and at the bottom of your shopping list but here’s what else we know – getting your car serviced regularly is necessary and could save you in the long run! Not only does it ensure that your car is kept in tip-top condition, keeping you and your family safe, but a regular small expense is much easier on the bank balance than a large unexpected one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>See, if you don’t regularly care for your car’s health you might have a whopper of a pay out later on a much bigger mechanical fault that could have been caught through regular servicing (and at a lower cost!). Not only that – a car’s resale value can even be reduced if it doesn’t come with a ‘full service history,’ meaning an assurance that the car was serviced regularly and as specified by the manufacturer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>Have we convinced you? Regular servicing really is important for your safety&nbsp;</span></strong><em><b><span>and</span></b></em><strong><span>&nbsp;your bank balance!</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>With that in mind, we want you to be clear on what all the technical language means when it comes to car servicing because we know it can be confusing. Often, going to a mechanic can be like going to foreign country if you aren’t familiar with the ins and outs of your vehicle and all the different terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>That’s why we have put together this helpful guide to e-CAR car servicing – so you can get more service savvy before coming in to see us!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>1.&nbsp; Petrol Servicing</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Vehicles run on lots of fluid, like oil and fuel, to keep going– in the servicing world we call this ‘lubrication.’ Without proper lubrication, your engine can not run.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>On more recent model cars, some manufacturers recommend that the oil is changed only every 30,000km in petrol vehicles due to how much oil technology has advanced. Manufacturers know their vehicles best and that’s why at e-CAR Service we service cars according to the manufacturer’s recommendation, including using the oils and lubricants they specifically recommend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>When it comes to petrol servicing e-CAR Service will service parts like oils, transmission lubricants, oil filters, air filters, fuel filters, etc and, as mentioned, all as according to the recommended specifics of the manufacturer. Which means you can drive away knowing your car has been lubricated to its optimum specifications!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>

<p>
    <strong><span>2.&nbsp; Diesel Servicing</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Vehicles run on lots of fluid, like oil and fuel, to keep going– in the servicing world we call this lubrication and, without proper lubrication, your engine can not run.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>On more recent model cars, some manufacturers recommend that the oil is changed only every 15,000km in diesel vehicles due to how much oil technology has advanced. Manufacturers know their vehicles best and that’s why at e-CAR Service we service cars according to the manufacturer’s recommendation, including using the oils and lubricants they specifically recommend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>

<p>
    <strong><span>3.&nbsp; Truck Servicing</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Our workshop specialises in truck servicing and repairs. We service all makes and types of trucks (over and under 6 tons), covering a whole host of problems like:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp; No power</span></strong><span><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard starting</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; No starting</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Excessive smoke</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; High fuel consumption</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Overheating</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Surging</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Uneven running engines</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuel problems</strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>At our workshop we can even refit the older systems with the latest common rail technology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>4.&nbsp; Diagnostics and tune-up</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>‘Diagnostics’ is a more technical element to car servicing – let us explain. When a mechanic services a car it is likely that he will use a ‘diagnostic tool’ to do so. A ‘diagnostic tool’ is a piece of software that assesses the car by looking at what the car says about itself through its own computer software and reporting. See most modern cars come with their own computer processors, micro chips and sensors today- they say that a modern car is made up of just as many electrical parts as it is mechanical! These electrical components can be connected directly to a diagnostics tool at a servicing centre or mechanics- telling the mechanic where the problem is. Clever or what?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>When a mechanic performs a car diagnostic test a whole range of problems can be revealed, from the petrol tank to the exhaust system, the cars transmission to the oil tank. Here at e-CAR Service we have the sophisticated diagnostic equipment and expertly trained technicians to work out exactly what your vehicles problem is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Diagnostic check of carburettor cars and earlier fuel injection vehicles</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Using the diagnostics tool (see above) our trained mechanics will inspect your ignition system and set the timings and exhaust gas mixture to your manufacturer’s specification. This is called a ‘tune up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Once we have given your car this ‘once-over’ with our diagnostic tool, we will be able to see whether your engine is running as it should and according to your manufacturer specifications. If there are any faults, with your ignition, fuel supply or electrics as an example, we’ll work hard to solve the problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Diagnostic check of fuel injection engines with management system</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Using the diagnostics tool (see above) our trained mechanics will connect to the technology system (electronic control unit – ECU) within your car, telling us where problems within the car are recorded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>In doing this diagnostics check we will be able to see whether the problems are to do with an original faulty part which will need to be replaced or if something has happened abnormally to your ECU. If that’s the case, then we’ll just clear the memory of an ECU- just like you would if you were cleaning or rebooting your home computer system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span><strong><i>Please note:</i></strong><em>&nbsp;The diagnostic check and fault finding process does not include any parts and labour required to repair the problem found during the fault finding process.</em><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>5.&nbsp; Auto Electrical Repairs</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>The modern car is made up of as many electrical parts as it is mechanical, meaning we have cars that can do a lot more than their older counterparts but also that they are also a lot more complex. Luckily for you, e-CAR Service workshops are skilled in mechanics and electrics! As a company, we partner with Diesel-Electric Group- the leading supplier of Bosch and other well known brands that supply specialised car electrical parts. Not only that but our workshops can access the Bosch database and connect to the Bosch Technical Helpline meaning that we can service your cars electrical components with the best possible resources to hand!

<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>8.&nbsp; Alarm and Immobiliser</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Unfortunately, in a world where we and technology are becoming more and more sophisticated- so are criminals. Which is why we only work with the most sophisticated and advanced technologies to protect you from crime!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Say hello to Sanji Intellica ZX300 ZX400 and ZX500. Catchy right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>The Sanji Intellica ZX Pro Series is arguably the most advanced alarm and mobiliser system in the world, manufactured to international standards. Take a look at its important features and then visit one of our workshops to have it installed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>Important features:</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>You get warned of any violation to your vehicle by a series of coded beeps on the siren. The ZX Series will shut down if its outputs are shorted or damaged<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The ZX Series anti highjack facility immobilises your vehicle if it is forcibly taken from you. The siren immediately sounds a warning and indicators flash, informing the hijacker that the car will stop in 90 seconds<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The ZX Series offers drivers-door or automatic passive arming hijack which are both programmable to suit your own requirement. The system gives you personal safety and protection outside the car. If you are attacked your transmitter becomes a panic button. If any doors, bonnet or boot aren’t properly closed, it will alert you!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Before you start it will check and lock your doors automatically. It will close your window and unlock the driver’s door selectively and separately from the passengers doors<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Secure sensing means your alarm will only activate if there is a problem<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Now that vehicle security systems have become so advanced, car thieves are turning to easier ways of getting your vehicle. Key theft or key duplication is the latest international method. Sanji however has developed an optional user identification keypad that interfaces with the alarm -this means that even if someone has your keys, your vehicle cannot be driven away<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>The ES250 miniature ultrasonic sensor works like an internal radar system. When the batteries of your remote are flat, you can override the system with a personal user pin code<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>9.&nbsp; Electric window repairs</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Our brilliant technicians are trained to repair all electric window installations, whether they are the original equipment or a conversion. And if you are still having to wind your windows up the old fashioned way, we have all the technology and skills to convert and install brand new electric windows too! Of course we only use the best systems- SPAL are a European design that has set the standard worldwide for quality electric windows and they are our window system of choice. Finally, you can experience the comfort and safety of operating all your windows with the touch of a button! No more winding or stretching to reach window winder handles!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>10.&nbsp; Park Distance Control</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Park distance control is a genius system that means you can park and manoeuvre easily, without bumping into anything! The system warns you if children, pets or any obstacle gets within the sensing range, it eliminates blind spots and even provides corner protection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Let’s face the facts – an international survey revealed that 27% of all accidents occur while reversing. 27%! That’s worth protecting yourself from, and our workshops and qualified technicians are the ones to install the brilliant system to ensure you do!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>A must for:</span></strong><span><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents with young children</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Vehicles with low visibility</strong><br />
    <strong>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Drivers with restricted movement</strong><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>How it works:</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Engaging reverse gear will activate the rear sensing system. The front system is activated when the ignition is turned on or when the speed is below 15 km/ h. The system beeps with increasing frequency as the object comes closer to the bumper and emits a constant beep when the object is 30 cm from the bumper. The sensing system starts from 1.20 m for the rear and 0.8 m for the front.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>Major feature:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The unique design and setup procedure of the interactive system ensures that the sensing range of all 4 sensors are identical, providing you with the most accurate and uniform sensing pattern across the entire width of the bumper. A feature that not all sensing system can boast!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>11.&nbsp; Tyre warning</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>How’s this for a fact? 65% of cars drive with under inflated tyres and 80% of tyre blow outs and subsequent loss of control is caused by under-inflated tyres. It’s for exactly this reason that we’ve made sure at e-CAR Service we can install an Auto Tyre pressure monitor into your car which keeps you informed about your tyre pressure and temperature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>Auto Tyre uses the latest technology to record the pressure and temperature of the tyre’s and will helpfully alert you through a flashing image displayed on your monitor if it isn’t as recommended. This system is essential if you want to put your safety first. As we know, if tyres are inflated to their manufacturer’s specification, the chance of blow out and a loss of control of the vehicle is severely reduced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <strong><span>12.&nbsp; Auto Cruise Control</span></strong><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>
    <span>If you aren’t familiar with ‘cruise control’ let us describe it as a system that automatically controls the speed of your car. It allows you to cruise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
